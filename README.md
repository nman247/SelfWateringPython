# SelfWateringPython

Contributors: Freenove(Borrowed Code), and Nasir Martin
Scope: Code made for Self Watering Kit. Collects Moisture Level as a Analog and converts to Digital for Raspberry Pi (Step is skippable with Arduino). Switches on Waterpump through relay. Best to not hook battery up directly to Raspberry Pi(Motors could send feedback into the line and damage system)! Needs External Source of Power!
